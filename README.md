<b>Purpose: </b>

- To create a drum kit using strictly JavaScript. All within the HTML file.
- Use CSS to apply 'animation' to each div containing the drum.

---
<b>Experience:</b> Interesting refresher project to practice DOM manipulation as well as stepping away from jQuery. The implementation CSS for animation was fun.

---

<b>Possible Improvements:</b>

- Create separate .js file eliminating scripts within HTML, thus cleaning up the HTML.
- Possible HTML/CSS improvements to upgrade design/visual.

---

<b>Notes:</b>

- Had to rename dir/path name due to inability to push from terminal. 
- Will need to evaluate if possible to remove prior dir/files to clean up repo. 
- Used keycode.info to find all keyboard key codes for possible future rearrangement.
